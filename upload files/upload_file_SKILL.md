# Skill: Upload File to Google Drive

## Purpose
Upload the file provided in this workflow run to the correct Google Drive folder, resolving the destination folder based on what the user specified in their prompt.

## When to use this skill
Trigger this skill whenever a file needs to be saved/uploaded to Google Drive as part of the workflow — typically as the final step after summarization or another processing skill has run.

## Inputs
- `file` (binary, required): The file to upload.
- `folder_name` (string, optional): Extracted from the user's prompt if they named a destination folder (e.g. "upload this to Invoices", "save it in the Client-X folder").
- `default_folder` (string, constant): `default_folder` — the fallback Drive folder used when no folder is named in the prompt.

## Steps
1. Parse the user's prompt for a folder name.
2. **If a folder name is specified:**
   a. Search Google Drive for a folder matching that name.
   b. If it exists, use its folder ID as the upload destination.
   c. If it does not exist, create a new folder with that exact name, then use the newly created folder's ID as the destination.
3. **If no folder name is specified in the prompt (file only):**
   a. Use `default_folder` as the upload destination. Do not create a new folder in this case — `default_folder` is assumed to already exist.
4. Upload `file` to the resolved destination folder.
5. Confirm success and report where the file ended up.

## Output format
```
Uploaded: <file_name>
Destination folder: <folder_name or "default_folder">
Folder status: <"existing" | "newly created" | "default">
Link: <Drive file/folder link, if available>
```

## Edge cases
- If multiple folders in Drive match the specified name (duplicates), use the first exact-name match and note the ambiguity in the output rather than failing silently.
- If folder creation fails (permissions, quota, etc.), report the failure clearly — do not fall back to `default_folder` without saying so, since that could put a file somewhere the user didn't ask for.
- If `file` is missing/empty when this skill runs, do not attempt an upload — return an error stating no file was found to upload.
- Folder name matching should be case-insensitive but should preserve the user's exact casing when creating a new folder.
